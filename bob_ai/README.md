# Bob AI - Whisky Recommendation System

Bob is an AI agent built to analyze users' virtual whisky collections and provide personalized bottle recommendations. This project implements the RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) component of Bob's recommendation engine.

## Overview

Bob analyzes a user's whisky collection to:
- Extract patterns and preferences (regions, styles, price points, ABV, etc.)
- Generate personalized recommendations based on collection analysis
- Provide detailed reasoning for each recommendation
- Suggest bottles within similar price ranges
- Recommend both similar and complementary bottles to diversify a collection

## Value Proposition

Bob AI brings sophisticated data science techniques to whisky recommendations, moving beyond simple category matching to understand the complex flavor profiles and characteristics that make each whisky unique. By analyzing your existing collection, Bob can identify patterns in your preferences that even you might not be consciously aware of, leading to discoveries that might otherwise remain hidden.

Unlike conventional recommendation systems that rely on broad categories or user ratings, Bob AI examines the detailed attributes of each whisky in your collection to find truly personalized matches, saving you from expensive disappointments and leading you to your next favorite bottle.


## Further Improvements

Potential enhancements:
1. Implement flavor profile analysis for more nuanced recommendations
2. Add user feedback mechanisms to improve recommendation quality
3. Include regional and distillery-specific knowledge
4. Optimize embedding and search for better performance
5. Expand the whisky database with additional metadata
